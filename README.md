# Webscraper 
---
### Description / Requirements

This project utilizes Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from Buzzfeed - namely, article titles, summaries of the articles, and their URls. Users can scrape new articles, pulling the latest articles from the site. They can then save articles for later reading. Finally, they can add their own notes to saved articles. The application utilizes Express to enable various Node packages, express-handlebars to populate the article database entries, Mongoose to organize database entries/Schema and relate entries to each other, Cheerio to facilitate webscraping, and Axios for making web requests.
